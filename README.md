According to the above URL 

"Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code."

This repository is intended to understand and apply some concepts through small projects. These ideas may then be extended to a real-world application.


In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This URL covers three main groups of patterns:

    1. Creational patterns: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    2. Structural patterns: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

    3. Behavioral patterns: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
